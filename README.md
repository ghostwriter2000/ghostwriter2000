👋 Hey there! I'm @ghostwriter2000


I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a knack for both offense and defense. I build tools, think security-first, and believe that keeping the digital realm safe is the need of the hour.

🧐 What’s on my radar…

I'm all about staying ahead of the curve, exploring new tools, and devising clever strategies to keep the baddies at bay.

🔧 Tools

I'm knee-deep in Python, Golang, and Bash scripting, refining my skills to whip up useful tools for everything from automation to ethical hacking.

Other programming languages I have experience in:
   - HTML
   - Javascript
   - Node.js
